PVR management functionality as defined in Section 7.10.4. This class implements the ScheduledRecording
interface (see Section 7.10.2), with the following changes: 
•  The startPaddingproperty is read only. 
•  For in-progress recordings, changes to the value of the endPaddingproperty SHALL modify the actual duration of 
the recording. If the value of the endPaddingproperty is changed so that the current actual duration of the 
recording exceeds the new actual duration specified by the sum of the startPadding, durationand 
endPaddingproperties, the recording SHALL bestopped immediately. Changing the value of this property for a 
completed recording SHALL have no effect. 
Recordings MAY be “manual” in that they simply record a channel at a certain time, for a period - analogous to a 
traditional VCR - or alternatively recordings can be programme based. 
If an in-progress recording is interrupted and automatically resumed, e.g. due to a temporary power failure, all sections of 
the recording SHALL be represented by a single Recordingobject. 
Values of properties in the Recordingobject SHALL be obtained from metadata about the recorded programme and 
are typically copied from the Programme used for scheduling a recording by the record(Programme programme)
method of the application/oipfRecordingSchedulerobject. In the event of a conflict between the metadata in 
the Programme and that in the broadcast channel, the conflict resolution is implementation dependent. 
See Section 7.10.4 for more information about the mapping between the properties of a Programmeand the BCG 
metadata. 
NOTE: The property parentalRatingsformerly defined as part of this class is now redundant following the 
renaming of the parentalRatingproperty in the ScheduledRecordingclass to parentalRatings.
